- User sign up
-- Name
-- Email
-- Password
-- Address
-- ICP

- User sign in
-- Check if user exists with same hashed password and has the same email

- Admin sign in
-- Currently same system as user sign in, should it be different?

----- Should addresses need to be unique constrained at the model/db level?? Can this instead be validated by the admin during the manual step? 

----- Added uniqueness constraints and presence constraints in the db level
